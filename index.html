      <p>
        If love had a sound, it would be your voice.  
        If peace had a shape, it would be your smile.  
        And if home had a name — it would be yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        You walked into my life quietly,  
        and somehow made everything louder, brighter, warmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you is not something I try to do.  
        It happens naturally — like breathing.

        I may not be perfect,

      <p class="highlight">
        I choose you —  
        in laughter, in silence,  
        in distance, in closeness,  
        today and every day.
